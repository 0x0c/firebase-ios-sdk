# Firebase In-App Messaging SwiftUI Extensions

This directory contains source files for the In-App Messaging SwiftUI extensions SDK.

## Installation

The FirebaseInAppMessagingSwiftUI module is currently only available for installation
through CocoaPods. To add FirebaseInAppMessagingSwiftUI to your project, add the
following to your Podfile

```ruby
pod 'FirebaseInAppMessagingSwiftUI'
```

You will need to import the FirebaseInAppMessagingSwiftUI module in any source file
that depends on it, since it's not automatically bundled with the FirebaseInAppMessaging
module.

```swift
import Firebase
import FirebaseInAppMessagingSwiftUI
```

The FirebaseInAppMessagingSwiftUI module does not provide any additional utility to
Objective-C projects, and therefore is not recommended for non-Swift projects.

## License

The Firebase In-App Messaging SwiftUI Extensions SDK is available under the Apache-2 license. See
the top-level LICENSE file for more details.
